## MAGA Protocol Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **VIOLATION**: Not all environments are GREEN

According to MAGA Protocol:
1. In Production state: All environments must be GREEN before new feature work
2. In Pre-Production state: Local environment must be GREEN, others may be YELLOW/RED

Current state: Pre-Production

**Pre-Production Focus**:
- Maintain Local as GREEN
- Focus on forward progression
- Work on making Docker GREEN next
- Prepare for Development environment deployment
