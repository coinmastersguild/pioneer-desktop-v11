# Milestone 3: Sprint 1 Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and enhancements implemented in Milestone 3, Sprint 1.

## 1. Issue Documentation: Space Bar Jumping & Pointer Lock Error

### Space Bar Jumping Issues
- **Problem**: The space bar jump functionality was implemented but not working correctly
- **Root Cause**: 
  - The jump implementation was modifying scene gravity (`this._gameScene._scene.gravity = new Vector3(0, this.jumpForce, 0)`) which is not an effective way to implement jumping
  - The reset mechanism for jumping wasn't working properly

### Pointer Lock Error
- **Problem**: Error message "The user has exited the lock before this request was completed" appearing
- **Root Cause**: Race condition between pointer lock being released and code trying to use it during the transition between clicked and non-clicked states

## 2. Implemented Fixes

### Grass Ground Plane (Blue Water Replacement)
- **Change**: Replaced the default blue water bottom with a green grass-colored nav mesh
- **Implementation**: 
  - Modified `AssetsController.prepareLevel()` to create a green grass plane instead of water
  - Added texture loading with proper fallback to solid color
  - Positioned the ground plane at Y = -0.5
  - Added material properties for a realistic grass appearance

### NavMesh Color Update
- **Change**: Made the navmesh debug view use a consistent green color
- **Implementation**: 
  - Modified `navMeshHelper.ts` to use a standardized grass green color
  - Improved visibility with slight transparency
  - Raised the debug mesh slightly to prevent z-fighting with the ground plane

## 3. Future Work

To fully address the identified issues, the following work is still needed:

### Jumping Mechanism Fix Plan
- Implement proper physics-based jumping using impulses
- Add jump sound effects
- Improve ground detection reliability

### Pointer Lock Error Fix Plan
- Create a safe pointer lock utility class
- Add proper state management for pointer lock transitions
- Implement error handling for all pointer lock operations
- Ensure all event listeners are properly cleaned up

## Testing
To verify these fixes:
1. Check that the blue water has been replaced with green grass
2. Enable navmesh debug view (`this._navMeshDebug.isVisible = true`) and verify it has a consistent green color
3. Test space jumping functionality in various scenarios
4. Test rapidly toggling pointer lock states to identify any remaining issues
