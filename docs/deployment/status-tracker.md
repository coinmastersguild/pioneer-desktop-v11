# KKSE Deployment Status Tracker

## Overview

This document serves as the central status tracker for the KeepKey Support Email application deployment across all environments. Before promoting code to `master`, all environments **MUST** show a GREEN status.

## Current Status

| Environment           | Status | Last Updated          | Health Check | E2E Tests | Notes                             |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Local                 | 游릭     | 2025-03-24 14:58      | PASS         | PASS      | Health endpoint with version verified |
| Local Docker          | 游릭     | 2025-03-24 15:54      | PASS         | PASS      | Docker E2E tests passed, container running on port 5001 |
| Develop Environment   | 游리     | 2025-03-24 14:58      | UNKNOWN      | UNKNOWN   | Environment not yet deployed - needs CI setup |
| Feature Environments  | 游댮     | 2025-03-24 14:58      | N/A          | N/A       | Feature environments not configured |
| Production            | 游댮     | 2025-03-24 14:58      | N/A          | N/A       | Not deployed to production |

## Status Legend

- 游릭 **GREEN**: All tests passing, deployment healthy
- 游리 **YELLOW**: Minor issues detected, deployment functional
- 游댮 **RED**: Critical issues, deployment failing

## Promotion Requirements

Before promoting code from `develop` to `master`:

1. **ALL** environments must show 游릭 GREEN status
2. Health checks must PASS in all environments
3. E2E tests must PASS in all environments
4. Feature environments must be verified and documented

## Status Update Process

### Automated Updates

The status is automatically updated by CircleCI after each build/deployment:

1. CircleCI runs tests and deployments
2. Status results are recorded in this document through a PR
3. Timestamps are updated to reflect the most recent check

### Manual Updates

For local environment verification:

```bash
# Run health endpoint verification (E2E test)
./skills/verify-health-endpoint.sh http://localhost:3000

# Update status document if manual update needed
./skills/update-status-tracker.sh local GREEN "Health check passed, version verified"
```
