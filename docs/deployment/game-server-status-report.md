# Game Server Status Report

## Executive Summary

The DegenQuest game server is currently **deployed but not accessible** to clients. The server is running in Kubernetes with a healthy deployment status (1/1 ready replicas), but health checks to the service's external IP fail with connection resets. This report details the current status, issues found, and recommendations for establishing proper health monitoring to ensure compliance with the MAGA (Master Always Green Approach) workflow.

## Current Infrastructure Status

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Deployment Name**: `degen-server`
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy (1/1 replicas running)
- **Image**: `registry.digitalocean.com/pioneer/degen-server:latest`
- **Creation Time**: March 17, 2025

### Kubernetes Service
- **Service Name**: `do-app-svc-degen-server-z1wl75ki`
- **Type**: LoadBalancer
- **External IP**: `134.199.184.182` (IPv4), `2604:a880:4:1d0::7c28:7000` (IPv6)
- **Port Configuration**: 80:31932/TCP (External:NodePort)
- **Target Port**: 3000
- **Session Affinity**: ClientIP (configured for WebSocket connections)

### Container Image
- **Repository**: `degen-server`
- **Tag**: `latest`
- **Updated**: March 17, 2025

## Health Check Results

| Check Method | Result | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Kubernetes Deployment | ✅ HEALTHY | Deployment is running with expected replicas |
| Kubernetes Service | ✅ ACTIVE | LoadBalancer service exists with external IP |
| HTTP Health Endpoint | ❌ FAILED | `curl http://134.199.184.182/health` - Connection reset by peer |
| HTTPS Connectivity | ❌ FAILED | Connection resets when attempting to connect |
| Docker Health Check | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | Local Docker containers not running |

## Analysis of Issues

1. **Connection Reset Issue**: The LoadBalancer service has an active external IP, but connections are being reset. This suggests one of the following:
   - The game server process is not actually running inside the container
   - A firewall is blocking connections
   - The service is pointing to the wrong container port
   - The application is crashing when handling requests

2. **Missing Health Checks in CI/CD Pipeline**: CircleCI configuration does not include explicit health verification after deployment, violating the MAGA principle of ensuring deployments are actually functional.

3. **Service Configuration**: The service is configured to expose port 3000, but our documentation suggests the game server should run on port 2567. This mismatch may be causing the connection issues.

4. **Improper Ingress Configuration**: No ingress resource was found, suggesting that proper routing, TLS termination, and hostname-based access might not be configured.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Container Health**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=degen-server -o name) -- ps aux
   ```

2. **Check Application Logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app=degen-server
   ```

3. **Verify Port Configuration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=degen-server -o json | jq '.items[0].spec.containers[0].ports'
   ```

### Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Add Kubernetes Health Probes**:
   - Add readiness and liveness probes to the Kubernetes deployment
   - Example configuration:
   ```yaml
   readinessProbe:
     httpGet:
       path: /health
       port: 2567
     initialDelaySeconds: 10
     periodSeconds: 5
   livenessProbe:
     httpGet:
       path: /health
       port: 2567
     initialDelaySeconds: 20
     periodSeconds: 15
   ```

2. **Deploy Proper Ingress Controller**:
   - Add a Kubernetes Ingress resource for proper HTTP/HTTPS routing
   - Configure TLS termination
   - Set up proper domain name routing

3. **Update Monitoring Scripts**:
   - Modify `skills/check-health.sh` to use the current server IP
   - Add monitoring to the CI/CD pipeline to verify deployments

### CI/CD Enhancements

1. **Add Post-Deployment Health Verification**:
   ```yaml
   - run:
       name: Verify Deployment Health
       command: |
         # Wait for service to be ready
         sleep 30
         
         # Get the LoadBalancer IP
         EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service -l app=degen-server -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
         
         # Check health endpoint
         if curl -s -f http://$EXTERNAL_IP/health; then
           echo "Deployment is healthy!"
         else
           echo "Deployment health check failed!"
           exit 1
         fi
   ```

2. **Add Auto-Rollback on Failed Health Checks**:
   - Implement automatic rollback to previous version if health checks fail
   - Essential for maintaining the MAGA workflow

## MAGA Workflow Compliance

The current setup violates the MAGA workflow principles in several ways:

1. **Green Status Verification**: The pipeline doesn't verify actual service health after deployment
2. **Early Detection**: Health issues aren't caught during the deployment process
3. **Monitoring**: No continuous monitoring is set up to detect problems that might occur after successful deployment

Implementing the recommendations in this report would bring the game server infrastructure into compliance with MAGA principles and ensure that a "green" status actually means the service is functioning correctly for users.

## Conclusion

The game server is technically deployed and the Kubernetes objects report healthy status, but the service is not actually functional for clients. This highlights the importance of implementing proper health checks at both the infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline levels. These improvements should be prioritized to ensure reliable game server availability and prevent false "green" statuses in the build process.
