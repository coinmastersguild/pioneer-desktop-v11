# Project State: PRODUCTION

**Date:** 2025-03-24
**Status:** PRODUCTION
**Previous State:** PRE-PRODUCTION

## State Transition

The KeepKey Support Email service has officially transitioned from Pre-Production to Production state.

This transition carries important protocol changes that affect how we approach all work on this project moving forward.

## Production State Protocol

As per our established Guild protocols, the Production state has the following requirements:

1. **Focus on backward protection**: Prod → Feature → Dev → Docker → Local
2. **ALL environments must be GREEN** before new feature work
3. **RED statuses must be fixed immediately**, starting with Production first
4. Work **backward** through environments when fixing issues

## Current Environment Status

| Environment | Status | Last Verified | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Production | GREEN | 2025-03-24T17:38:31-03:00 | Kubernetes pod running with health check passing |
| Feature | RED | 2025-03-24T17:45:00-03:00 | Feature environments not yet configured |
| Dev | YELLOW | 2025-03-24T16:53:58-03:00 | CircleCI build successful, needs full verification |
| Docker | GREEN | 2025-03-24T16:53:58-03:00 | Successfully built and pushed to registry.digitalocean.com/pioneer/support-email:latest-dev |
| Local | GREEN | 2025-03-24T16:00:00-03:00 | Local development environment verified working |

## Environment Status Files

We maintain status files for each environment in the `deployment/status/` directory:

- Production: `deployment/status/production.status`
- Feature: `deployment/status/feature.status`
- Dev: `deployment/status/dev.status`
- Docker: `deployment/status/docker.status`
- Local: `deployment/status/local.status`

## Verification Tools

The following tools must be used to verify each environment:

- **Production**: `skills/k8s/verify-k8s-deployment.sh`
- **Feature**: Depends on feature branches, use appropriate verification
- **Dev**: `skills/verify-circleci-docker.sh --job build-and-push --update-status --environment dev`
- **Docker**: `skills/verify-docker.sh`
- **Local**: `skills/verify-local.sh`

## Development Workflow

Under Production state, all development must follow this workflow:

1. **Verify all environments** are GREEN before starting new work
2. If any environment is RED, **fix it before proceeding** with new features
3. When fixing issues, **start with Production** first, then work backward
4. All changes must pass **stricter testing requirements**
5. **Document all changes** with appropriate sprint documentation

## Next Steps

Based on our current environment status, we need to:

1. Fix the Feature environment (RED) - highest priority after Production
2. Complete full verification of Dev environment (YELLOW)
3. Ensure all environments maintain GREEN status
