# Multi-Server Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing multi-server support in DegenQuest-v3. The ability to connect to multiple game servers is essential for scalability, regional support, and specialized gameplay environments.

## Implementation Goals

1. Implement server selection screen
2. Build server status monitoring system
3. Create web-native server browser (to be used BEFORE game launch)
4. Display server URL in-game (in bottom left corner, like in DegenQuest-v2)
5. Improve error handling for failed server connections

## Server Selection Screen

### Design Requirements

1. The server selection screen will be presented BEFORE the game launches
2. It will display a list of available servers with their status, region, and player count
3. Users can favorite servers for quick access
4. The last connected server will be remembered

### Implementation Details

```typescript
interface GameServer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  url: string;
  region: string;
  status: "online" | "offline" | "maintenance";
  playerCount: number;
  maxPlayers: number;
  ping: number;
  isFavorite: boolean;
}
```

## Server Status Monitoring

1. Implement a central server registry service
2. Each game server will report its status, player count, and health metrics
3. The client will query this service to display server status
4. Implement automatic health checks and alerting

## Web-Native Server Browser

### Features

1. Accessible via web browser before launching the game
2. Displays detailed server information
3. Allows filtering by region, player count, and status
4. "Play Now" button launches the game and connects to the selected server
5. RESTful API to retrieve server information

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for server registry

## In-Game Server Display

1. Display the current server URL in the bottom left corner of the game interface
2. Show connection status indicator
3. Allow in-game server switching through the pause menu
4. Persist player data across server switches where appropriate

## Error Handling Improvements

### Connection Failure Handling

1. Display user-friendly error messages
2. Offer troubleshooting steps
3. Implement automatic reconnection attempts
4. Provide option to select alternative servers

### Error Types & Messages

| Error Type | User Message | Action |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Server Offline | "The server is currently offline. Please try another server." | Show server selection screen |
| Connection Timeout | "Connection timed out. Check your internet connection or try another server." | Retry connection |
| Server Full | "This server is currently full. Please try again later or select another server." | Show server selection screen |
| Authentication Failed | "Authentication failed. Please log in again." | Redirect to login |

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement the server selection UI
2. Create the server registry service
3. Implement in-game server status display
4. Improve connection error handling
5. Conduct thorough cross-server testing
