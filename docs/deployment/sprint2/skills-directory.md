# Skills Directory Implementation

## Overview

The skills directory will serve as a centralized location for all character abilities and skills in the game. This will make it easier to manage, test, and deploy new skills without affecting other game systems.

## Implementation Goals

1. Create a structured directory for all game skills
2. Implement makefiles for easy skill compilation and deployment
3. Develop bash scripts to automate development workflows
4. Ensure local startup process is streamlined

## Directory Structure

```
/skills
├── attack/
│   ├── melee/
│   │   ├── slash.ts
│   │   ├── stab.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── ranged/
│   │   ├── shoot.ts
│   │   ├── throw.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── magic/
│       ├── fireball.ts
│       ├── ice_spike.ts
│       └── ...
├── defense/
│   ├── block.ts
│   ├── dodge.ts
│   └── ...
├── utility/
│   ├── heal.ts
│   ├── buff.ts
│   └── ...
└── Makefile
```

## Makefile Implementation

The Makefile will include targets for:

- `make skills`: Compiles all skills
- `make test-skills`: Runs tests for all skills
- `make deploy-skills`: Deploys skills to the appropriate environment
- `make new-skill TYPE=attack NAME=new_attack`: Creates a new skill with boilerplate code

## Bash Scripts

We'll create the following bash scripts:

1. `setup-skills.sh`: Sets up the initial skills directory structure
2. `compile-skills.sh`: Compiles all skills into optimized code
3. `test-skills.sh`: Runs automated tests for all skills
4. `skills-hot-reload.sh`: Enables hot reloading during development

## Integration with Local Startup

1. The local startup process will be modified to load skills from the skills directory
2. Changes to skills will be automatically detected and loaded
3. A debug panel will be added to test skills in-game

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each skill
2. Integration tests to ensure skills work with other game systems
3. Performance tests to ensure skills don't impact game performance

## Next Steps

1. Create the initial directory structure
2. Implement the Makefile
3. Create and test the bash scripts
4. Update the game to load skills from the skills directory
