# DegenQuest Server Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased approach to implementing the multi-server architecture for DegenQuest-v3. Each phase is broken down into specific milestones with measurable outcomes to ensure steady progress and early validation.

## Overview

The goal is to create a robust multi-server architecture that allows players to:
1. View and select from multiple game servers before launching the game
2. See server status and connection information in-game
3. Experience smooth error handling and recovery from connection issues
4. Optionally switch servers without restarting the game

## Phase 1: Local Infrastructure & Basic Display

- [ ] Add simple filtering and sorting
- [ ] Implement mobile-responsive design
- **Validation**: Web browser shows accurate server information from registry

## Phase 3: Game Client Server Selection & Enhanced Error Handling

**Goal**: Improve game client to handle server selection and connection issues gracefully

### Milestone 3.1: Enhanced Connection Logic (2-3 days)
- [ ] Refactor connection logic to support reconnection attempts
- [ ] Implement more detailed connection status tracking
- [ ] Add timeout handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- **Validation**: Game handles connection failures gracefully with informative messages

### Milestone 3.2: Server Configuration Management (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create persistent storage for server configurations
- [ ] Add last-connected server memory
- [ ] Implement server favorites functionality
- [ ] Create server configuration UI in game settings
- **Validation**: Game remembers last server and reconnects automatically

### Milestone 3.3: In-Game Server Switching (3-4 days)
- [ ] Add server selection screen to pause menu
- [ ] Implement clean disconnection and reconnection logic
- [ ] Create transition screens for server switching
- [ ] Add data persistence across server switches where appropriate
- **Validation**: Player can switch servers without restarting the game

## Phase 4: Web-to-Game Integration & Advanced Features

**Goal**: Create seamless integration between web browser and game client

### Milestone 4.1: Custom Protocol Handler (3-4 days)
- [ ] Research and document custom protocol requirements for different platforms
- [ ] Implement custom protocol handler in game client
- [ ] Create launcher script for protocol registration
- [ ] Test protocol handling across platforms
- **Validation**: Clicking links with `degenquest://` protocol launches the game

### Milestone 4.2: Web-to-Game Launch Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Add "Play Now" button to web server browser
- [ ] Implement secure parameter passing from web to game
- [ ] Create loading/transition states for launch process
- [ ] Add validation and error handling for launch parameters
- **Validation**: Clicking "Play Now" in web browser launches game with selected server

### Milestone 4.3: Advanced Web Features (3-4 days)
- [ ] Implement user accounts for web browser
- [ ] Add server favorites that sync between web and game
- [ ] Create performance history charts for servers
- [ ] Add community features (server reviews, population history)
- **Validation**: Users can manage preferences across web and game seamlessly

## Phase 5: Administration & Monitoring

**Goal**: Provide tools for server operators and administrators

### Milestone 5.1: Administrator Interface (3-4 days)
- [ ] Create administrative views for server management
- [ ] Implement server registration/deregistration workflow
- [ ] Add server configuration management tools
- [ ] Create access control for administrative functions
- **Validation**: Administrators can manage servers through web interface

### Milestone 5.2: Advanced Monitoring (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement detailed server metrics collection
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up automatic alerting for server issues
- [ ] Add performance analytics and reporting
- **Validation**: System provides early warning of server problems

### Milestone 5.3: Server Scaling & Management (3-4 days)
- [ ] Implement server tags and categories
- [ ] Add region-based routing and suggestions
- [ ] Create server maintenance mode and scheduling
- [ ] Implement server capacity planning tools
- **Validation**: System helps balance player population across servers

## Testing Strategy

Each milestone should include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Manual Validation**: Verify functionality with real users

### Test Environments

1. **Local Development**: Docker containers on developer machines
2. **Test Environment**: Shared testing servers for integration
3. **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
4. **Production**: Live game servers

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Game Client | Existing TypeScript/Babylon.js |
| Game Server | Node.js in Docker containers |
| Server Registry | Express.js, MongoDB |
| Web Interface | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana |

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Custom protocol issues on different OS | High | High | Early prototype testing on all platforms |
| Performance impact of status display | Medium | Medium | Optimize rendering and update frequency |
| Security concerns with launch parameters | High | High | Implement validation and sanitization |
| Database scalability issues | Medium | High | Design for horizontal scaling from start |

## Prioritized Implementation Order

If resources are limited, implementation should proceed in this order:

1. Local Docker container setup
2. In-game server information display
3. Basic server registry API
4. Enhanced connection error handling
5. Simple web server browser
6. Server configuration management
7. Custom protocol handler
8. Web-to-game integration
9. Administrator interface
10. Advanced features (favorites, history, etc.)

This approach maximizes early value delivery while building toward the complete solution.
