# Dockerized Game Server Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a dockerized game server for DegenQuest-v3. Docker will ensure consistency across development and production environments while simplifying deployment.

## Implementation Goals

1. Create Docker configuration for the game server
2. Implement local Docker-based deployment
3. Ensure consistent environment between development and production
4. Simplify the setup process for new developers

## Docker Configuration

### Base Image

We'll use Node.js as our base image:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 2567

CMD ["npm", "run", "start:server"]
```

### Docker Compose Setup

To manage multiple services (game server, database, etc.), we'll use Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  game-server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.server
    ports:
      - "2567:2567"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DB_HOST=db
    volumes:
      - ./apps/game-server:/app/apps/game-server
    depends_on:
      - db
    
  db:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
```

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start all services
3. Access the game server at `localhost:2567`
4. Development changes will be automatically detected via volume mounts

## Local Testing Process

1. Build the Docker image: `docker-compose build`
2. Start the containers: `docker-compose up`
3. Run tests: `docker-compose exec game-server npm test`
4. Connect game client to the dockerized server

## Performance Considerations

1. Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
2. Implement proper caching strategies for dependencies
3. Configure resource limits for containers

## Security Considerations

1. Run containers as non-root users
2. Implement proper network isolation
3. Regularly update base images and dependencies

## CI/CD Integration

The Docker setup will be integrated with our CI/CD pipeline to:
1. Build and test Docker images on each commit
2. Deploy images to a container registry
3. Automatically deploy to staging/production

## Next Steps

1. Create the Dockerfile for the game server
2. Set up Docker Compose configuration
3. Test local development with Docker
4. Document the setup process for the team
