# Deployment Protocol

## Core Principles

1. **No Silent Failures**
   - All deployment steps must explicitly succeed or fail
   - Deployment script must exit with non-zero status if ANY check fails
   - All service health checks must be GREEN before proceeding

2. **Status Reporting Protocol**
   - Every deployment must report status for:
     - Frontend Services (Support UI, Admin Dashboard)
     - Backend Services (Messaging, Pioneer)
     - Database Connections
     - WebSocket Connections
     - Third-party Service Integration Status

3. **Health Check Requirements**
   - Each service must implement `/health` endpoint
   - Health checks must verify:
     - Database connectivity
     - Required service connections (Pioneer, WebSocket)
     - Memory usage within limits
     - Response times within SLA
     - No critical errors in logs

4. **Deployment Verification Steps**

```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment Checks
- Verify all ports are available
- Check environment variables
- Verify database connections
- Check disk space and resources

# 2. Service Deployment
- Deploy in correct order (backend â†’ frontend)
- Verify each service individually
- Check for migration needs

# 3. Integration Verification
- Test service-to-service communication
- Verify WebSocket connections
- Check Pioneer integration
- Validate chat functionality

# 4. Post-deployment Verification
- Run E2E tests
- Check error rates
- Verify performance metrics
```

5. **Error Recovery Protocol**
   - Automatic rollback on critical failures
   - Error logs must be preserved
   - Incident report required for failed deployments

## Deployment Script Requirements

1. **Status Colors**
   - ðŸŸ¢ GREEN: All checks passed
   - ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW: Warning but operational
   - ðŸ”´ RED: Critical failure

2. **Required Health Checks**
```typescript
interface HealthCheck {
  status: 'ok' | 'warning' | 'error';
  checks: {
    database?: boolean;
    pioneer?: boolean;
    websocket?: boolean;
    memory?: boolean;
    errors?: string[];
  };
  timestamp: string;
}
```

3. **Logging Requirements**
   - Structured JSON logging
   - Error stack traces preserved
   - Performance metrics included
   - Request/Response logging for debugging

## Sprint Protocol

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Review deployment checklist
   - Verify all environment variables
   - Check for breaking changes
   - Review migration needs

2. **During Deployment**
   - Real-time status monitoring
   - Log aggregation active
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error rate monitoring

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Verify all health checks GREEN
   - Run full E2E test suite
   - Check error logs
   - Verify all integrations

4. **Status Report**
   - Generate deployment report
   - Document any warnings/errors
   - Performance metrics summary
   - Action items for improvements

## Improvement Tracking

1. **Deployment Metrics**
   - Deployment time
   - Error rate
   - Recovery time
   - Service health scores

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Keep deployment docs current
   - Document all known issues
   - Maintain troubleshooting guide
   - Update improvement backlog
