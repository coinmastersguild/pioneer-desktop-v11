# Deployment Validation Guide

This guide outlines the process for validating deployments to staging and production environments. Following these steps ensures that your deployment is successful and all critical functionality works as expected.

## Staging Environment Validation

After deploying to staging, follow these steps to validate the deployment:

### 1. Initial Availability Check

- [ ] Confirm that the application loads at https://staging.degenquest.com
- [ ] Verify that all application routes are accessible
- [ ] Check for any immediate console errors in browser developer tools

### 2. Core Functionality Tests

#### User Authentication
- [ ] Register a new test user
- [ ] Log in with existing credentials
- [ ] Test password reset functionality
- [ ] Verify user profile updates

#### Web Portal
- [ ] Verify homepage content is correct
- [ ] Check navigation between pages
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm server selection interface works

#### Admin Panel
- [ ] Log in to admin panel
- [ ] Check system health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Verify user management functionality
- [ ] Test analytics and reporting features

#### Game Client
- [ ] Launch game from web portal
- [ ] Verify character creation/selection
- [ ] Test basic game mechanics
- [ ] Confirm that game progress saves correctly

### 3. Integration Tests

- [ ] Complete an end-to-end user journey from registration to gameplay
- [ ] Test integration between web portal and game client
- [ ] Verify admin panel reflects user activity correctly
- [ ] Check that analytics are being properly tracked

### 4. Performance Checks

- [ ] Measure page load times (<3s target)
- [ ] Check API response times (<200ms target)
- [ ] Test with multiple simultaneous connections (if possible)
- [ ] Monitor server resources during testing

### 5. Security Verification

- [ ] Verify that authentication is required for protected routes
- [ ] Test API endpoints for proper authorization
- [ ] Check for common security issues (XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] Verify that sensitive data is not exposed

## Addressing Issues in Staging

If issues are found during staging validation:

1. Document each issue with:
   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots or console logs
   - Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

2. For each issue, determine if it is a:
   - Blocker for production release
   - Non-blocker that can be fixed post-release
   - Feature that can be temporarily disabled

3. Create tickets for all issues found

4. For blockers:
   - Make fixes in the release branch
   - Push changes
   - Re-validate after deployment

## Production Deployment Validation

After deploying to production, perform these additional checks:

### 1. Smoke Tests

- [ ] Verify application loads at https://degenquest.com
- [ ] Test user login and core features
- [ ] Check that all services are operational
- [ ] Verify that third-party integrations work

### 2. Monitoring

- [ ] Check error rates in monitoring tools
- [ ] Monitor user activity for abnormalities
- [ ] Review server metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical metrics

### 3. Database Checks

- [ ] Verify database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Check database performance metrics
- [ ] Ensure backup systems are functioning

### 4. Post-Deployment Communications

- [ ] Notify internal teams of successful deployment
- [ ] Update status page if public-facing
- [ ] Prepare support team for any known issues
- [ ] Communicate new features to users if applicable

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are found in production:

1. Assess the impact and urgency
2. If immediate action is needed, initiate rollback:
   ```bash
   # Deploy the previous version's tag
   ./scripts/rollback.sh vX.Y.(Z-1)
   ```
3. Notify all stakeholders about the rollback
4. Document the issues that led to rollback
5. Create a plan to fix issues before attempting redeployment

## Deployment Sign-Off

Before considering a deployment fully validated, the tester should complete a sign-off:

```
DEPLOYMENT SIGN-OFF

Environment: [Staging/Production]
Version: [vX.Y.Z]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Tester: [Name]

Core Functionality: [PASS/FAIL]
Integration Tests: [PASS/FAIL]
Performance: [PASS/FAIL]
Security: [PASS/FAIL]

Issues Found: [None/List issues with severity]

Final Status: [APPROVED/REJECTED]
