# DegenQuest Game Server Deployment: Success Report

**Date:** 2025-03-22
**Version:** 0.0.2
**Environment:** Production
**Status:** âœ… SUCCESS

## Summary

The DegenQuest game server has been successfully deployed to production with version 0.0.2. Our health endpoint is functioning correctly, and we can confirm connectivity to the production environment through the official domain (api.degenquest.ai).

## Key Achievements

1. **Version Bump Implementation:** Successfully updated the server version from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2
2. **Health Endpoint Enhancement:** Added a robust health endpoint that provides version information
3. **Production Deployment:** Successfully deployed to Kubernetes cluster with zero downtime
4. **DNS Configuration:** Confirmed proper routing through the production domain (api.degenquest.ai)
5. **Logging Improvements:** Enhanced logging in Auth.ts for better production monitoring

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- Modified `Api.ts` to add the `/health` endpoint that returns server status and version
- Updated `Config.ts` to remove client module references that were causing build issues
- Optimized Docker build process for the game server

### Deployment Process
- Built and pushed Docker image to DigitalOcean Container Registry
- Rolled out changes to Kubernetes deployment using kubectl
- Verified deployment status with health checks

### Verification Steps Performed
1. Confirmed Docker image build success
2. Verified deployment in Kubernetes (running latest version)
3. Validated health endpoint response: `{"status":"OK","version":"0.0.2"}`
4. Confirmed connection to production DNS (api.degenquest.ai)

## Next Steps

1. **Game Client Deployment:** Prepare and deploy the game client to Vercel
2. **Integration Testing:** Ensure client-server communication works in production
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Set up dashboards to track server performance
4. **Documentation:** Update project documentation with deployment details

## Lessons Learned

1. Following the deployment rules in `/docs/deployment/rules` is critical for success
2. Using proper tools in `/skills` directory improves deployment efficiency
3. The health endpoint is essential for quick verification of deployment status
