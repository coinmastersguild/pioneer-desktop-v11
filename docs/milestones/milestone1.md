# Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Integration

## Step 1: Clone and Run Aider Locally
- Clone the Aider repository from GitHub.
- Set up the local environment and ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Run Aider locally to verify the setup.

## Step 2: Configure with OpenAI
- Integrate OpenAI API keys into the environment configuration.
- Verify that Aider can access and utilize OpenAI services.
- Ensure directory tracking is enabled for Aider.

## Step 3: Process Execution Wrapper
- Implement a process execution wrapper around Aider using `process.exec`.
- Stream logs from Aider to a designated log file or console.
- Ensure logs are accessible for debugging and monitoring.

## Step 4: API Integration
- Develop a REST API wrapper with WebSocket support for Aider.
- Implement endpoints to pass commands to Aider via the API.
- Use Bun for efficient server-side operations.

## Step 5: Lifecycle Management
- Define lifecycle states: NOT_CONFIGURED, RUNNING, HALTED.
- Implement state transitions with diagnostic messages for HALTED state.

## Step 6: Apply Guild Protocol
- Ensure all development follows the Guild's sprint and setup protocols.
- Document each step and maintain compliance with the protocol.

## Step 7: Monitoring and State Reporting
- Implement monitoring to track real-time state within the protocol.
- Develop an API to report the current state and health of the system.

## Step 8: Continuous Integration and Updates
- Set up a system for live updates to the Guild protocol.
- Automate the process of pushing updates to the Guild via pull requests.
