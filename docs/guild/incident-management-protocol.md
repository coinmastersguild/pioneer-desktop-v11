# Incident Management Protocol

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: Current Date  
**Status**: Active  

This document outlines the standard protocols for handling incidents related to the Pioneer Agent system. It follows the incident management framework specified in the [Enhanced Guild Protocols](./enhanced-guild-protocols.md).

## Incident Severity Classification

### SEV1: Critical - Complete System Outage
- Production system completely unavailable
- Customer-facing services non-functional
- Data loss or corruption affecting multiple users
- Security breach with significant impact

**Response Requirements**:
- Immediate response required (within 15 minutes)
- All-hands required until resolution or mitigation
- Executive notification required
- 24/7 continuous work until resolved

### SEV2: High - Significant Functionality Impaired
- Major feature or component unavailable
- Performance degradation affecting most users
- Partial system outage
- Security vulnerability with potential for exploitation

**Response Requirements**:
- Response within 1 hour
- Dedicated incident team assigned
- Regular updates every 2 hours
- Extended working hours until resolved

### SEV3: Medium - Minor Functionality Impaired
- Non-critical feature unavailable
- Performance issues affecting some users
- Intermittent issues with workarounds available
- Security concern requiring attention

**Response Requirements**:
- Response within 1 business day
- Assigned to specific team members
- Daily updates until resolved
- Resolution within standard working hours

### SEV4: Low - Cosmetic or Non-Critical Issues
- UI/UX issues not affecting functionality
- Minor bugs with easy workarounds
- Documentation issues
- Non-urgent enhancement requests

**Response Requirements**:
- Response within 3 business days
- Addressed in next sprint
- Standard update frequency

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Reporting

- Incidents may be detected through:
  - Automated monitoring alerts
  - Customer reports
  - Team member observations
- All incidents must be logged in the incident tracking system
- Initial severity assessment performed by on-call engineer

### 2. Triage and Classification

- Validate the incident and confirm severity level
- Assign incident commander based on severity
- Form response team as needed
- Create incident channel for communication
- Begin incident timeline documentation

### 3. Investigation and Diagnosis

- Gather information about the incident
- Review recent changes or deployments
- Analyze logs and monitoring data
- Determine scope and impact
- Identify potential root causes

### 4. Mitigation and Resolution

- Implement immediate mitigation if possible
- Develop action plan for resolution
- Execute resolution steps
- Validate resolution effectiveness
- Confirm system stability after fix

### 5. Communication

**Internal Communication**:
- Regular updates in incident channel
- Status updates at defined intervals based on severity
- Clear handoffs between team members

**External Communication** (if applicable):
- Customer notifications based on severity and impact
- Regular status updates on service status page
- Final resolution notification

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

- Conduct post-mortem meeting within 48 hours
- Document findings in post-mortem report
- Identify and assign action items
- Update runbooks and documentation
- Share lessons learned with team

## Incident Commander Responsibilities

The Incident Commander (IC) is responsible for:
- Coordinating overall incident response
- Assigning tasks to team members
- Making critical decisions during the incident
- Ensuring proper communication flow
- Escalating when necessary
- Maintaining the incident timeline
- Leading the post-mortem process

## Post-Mortem Requirements

All SEV1 and SEV2 incidents require a formal post-mortem. The post-mortem document must include:

1. **Incident Summary**
   - Brief description of the incident
   - Timeline (detection, response, resolution)
   - Severity and impact assessment

2. **Timeline of Events**
   - Detailed chronological account
   - Key decision points
   - Actions taken

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Primary and contributing causes
   - Technical factors
   - Process factors
   - Communication factors

4. **Resolution Steps**
   - Actions taken to resolve the incident
   - Effectiveness of resolution
   - Any workarounds implemented

5. **Preventive Measures**
   - Technical improvements needed
   - Process improvements needed
   - Monitoring improvements needed

6. **Action Items**
   - Specific tasks with clear owners
   - Due dates
   - Priority levels
   - Tracking mechanism

## Incident Drills

Quarterly incident drills will be conducted to maintain readiness:

1. **Drill Planning**
   - Scenario development
   - Participant selection
   - Success criteria definition

2. **Drill Execution**
   - Simulated incident response
   - Rotating incident commander role
   - Documentation practice

3. **Drill Evaluation**
   - Review of response effectiveness
   - Identification of improvement areas
   - Update to response procedures

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Service | SEV1 RTO | SEV2 RTO | SEV3 RTO |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Core API Services | 30 minutes | 2 hours | 1 business day |
| Database Services | 1 hour | 4 hours | 1 business day |
| Auxiliary Services | 4 hours | 8 hours | 2 business days |
| Non-Critical Services | 24 hours | 48 hours | 5 business days |
