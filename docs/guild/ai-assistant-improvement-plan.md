# AI Assistant Improvement Plan

**Document Type**: Self-Improvement Protocol  
**Created**: 2025-03-22  
**Status**: Active

## Identified Deficiencies

After analyzing the sprint planning documents, the following deficiencies have been identified in my approach:

1. **Excessive Abstraction**: Generated sprint plans that focused on generalized concepts without actionable specifics
2. **Theoretical Over Practical**: Emphasized theoretical architecture over practical implementation steps
3. **Missing Verification**: Failed to specify concrete verification methods and success criteria
4. **Imprecise References**: Did not reference specific files, endpoints, or code artifacts
5. **Feature-Focused vs. Implementation-Focused**: Described what to build rather than how to build it

## Improvement Objectives

1. **Increase Implementation Specificity**: Focus on exact files, scripts, and endpoints
2. **Adopt Test-First Mentality**: Define verification criteria before implementation steps
3. **Reference Existing Code**: Always connect new work to existing code artifacts
4. **Executable Over Descriptive**: Prioritize runnable commands over abstract descriptions
5. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Focus on making things work rather than architectural elegance

## Self-Correction Techniques

When generating sprint planning documents, I will:

1. **Start with Verification**: Define how success will be measured before describing implementation
2. **Reference Specific Files**: Always include file paths when describing changes
3. **Include Commands**: Provide actual commands to run for testing and implementation
4. **Focus on "How" Not "What"**: Describe implementation steps rather than just features
5. **Consider Developer Experience**: Prioritize clarity and actionability over completeness

## Before/After Example

### BEFORE (Problematic Approach)
```
2. **Client Setup**
   - Prepare the Eliza client interface for deployment
   - Ensure proper integration with the server
   - Configure for production environment
```

### AFTER (Improved Approach)
```
2. **Client Setup**
   - Run `npm run deploy-client` from top-level package.json
   - Verify client loads at http://localhost:[port]
   - Test connection to server by checking network tab for API calls to /health
   - Implement server selector component in client/src/components/ServerSelector.tsx
```

## Monitoring Progress

I will measure improvement by:

1. **Actionability Score**: How directly can tasks be executed without further clarification
2. **Verification Clarity**: How clearly success criteria are defined
3. **Command Specificity**: Whether actual commands are included for implementation
4. **Reference Precision**: How precisely code artifacts are referenced

## Continuous Improvement

This document will be updated as new patterns of effectiveness or deficiency are identified.
