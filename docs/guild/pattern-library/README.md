# Pioneer Agent Pattern Library

This directory contains documented patterns that have been identified, tested, and refined through the Guild's knowledge distillation process. These patterns represent proven solutions to recurring problems within our domain.

## What is a Pattern?

A pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in a specific context. Each pattern in this library includes:

- A clear problem statement
- The context in which the pattern applies
- A proven solution approach
- Implementation considerations
- Known tradeoffs
- Examples of successful application

## Pattern Categories

### Architectural Patterns
Solutions addressing system-level design challenges:
- [Service Communication Patterns](./architectural/service-communication-patterns.md)
- [Data Flow Patterns](./architectural/data-flow-patterns.md)
- [Scalability Patterns](./architectural/scalability-patterns.md)

### Design Patterns
Object-oriented and module-level design solutions:
- [State Management Patterns](./design/state-management-patterns.md)
- [Component Composition Patterns](./design/component-composition-patterns.md)
- [Resource Management Patterns](./design/resource-management-patterns.md)

### Integration Patterns
Approaches for integrating with external systems:
- [API Gateway Patterns](./integration/api-gateway-patterns.md)
- [External Service Integration Patterns](./integration/external-service-patterns.md)
- [Authentication Integration Patterns](./integration/authentication-patterns.md)

### Implementation Patterns
Concrete coding patterns and idioms:
- [Error Handling Patterns](./implementation/error-handling-patterns.md)
- [Asynchronous Processing Patterns](./implementation/async-processing-patterns.md)
- [Test Implementation Patterns](./implementation/testing-patterns.md)

### Process Patterns
Team workflow and development process patterns:
- [Feature Development Patterns](./process/feature-development-patterns.md)
- [Code Review Patterns](./process/code-review-patterns.md)
- [Incident Response Patterns](./process/incident-response-patterns.md)

## Pattern Evolution

Patterns in this library evolve through several stages:

1. **Candidate**: Identified but limited application
2. **Emerging**: Successfully applied in specific contexts
3. **Established**: Broadly applicable with well-understood tradeoffs
4. **Core**: Fundamental to our engineering approach

Each pattern is tagged with its current stage to indicate maturity.

## Using the Pattern Library

The patterns in this library should be:

- **Referenced** in architecture and design documents
- **Applied** during implementation where appropriate
- **Taught** to new team members
- **Evolved** based on practical experience
- **Challenged** when they no longer serve their purpose

## Contributing New Patterns

To propose a new pattern:

1. Use the [pattern template](./pattern-template.md)
2. Document the problem and solution
3. Provide concrete examples
4. Submit for review per the Knowledge Distillation Framework
5. Apply and refine based on feedback
