## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth

**Status**: Core  
**Confidence**: Proven  
**Origin**: ADR-003, Multiple project retrospectives  

#### Statement
Each piece of data should have a single authoritative source with a clear ownership model.

#### Rationale
Multiple sources of the same data inevitably lead to inconsistencies, synchronization problems, and uncertainty about which source is authoritative.

#### Implications
- Data models must clearly identify ownership boundaries
- Cross-boundary data access patterns must be explicit and controlled
- Cache invalidation strategies must be well-defined
- Derived data must be clearly labeled as non-authoritative

#### Contextual Considerations
- Applies strongly in centralized data models
- May require adaptation in distributed systems where eventual consistency is acceptable
- Performance optimizations through controlled duplication must be explicitly designed

#### Application Examples
- User profile data in Authentication Service
- Configuration management in Config Service
- Product catalog in Inventory Service

#### Evolution History
Initially focused on database design, expanded to include microservice boundaries and API contracts.

### 2. Simplicity Over Cleverness

**Status**: Core  
**Confidence**: Proven  
**Origin**: Multiple incident post-mortems, Knowledge synthesis  

#### Statement
Choose straightforward, well-understood approaches over clever, complex solutions unless there's a compelling and measurable need.

#### Rationale
Complex solutions increase cognitive load, make maintenance and debugging more difficult, and often introduce unexpected behaviors and dependencies.

#### Implications
- Prefer standard patterns and well-understood technologies
- Value readability and maintainability over minor optimizations
- Justify complexity with concrete requirements and metrics
- Document thoroughly when complexity is necessary

#### Contextual Considerations
- Critical performance paths may justify additional complexity
- Security concerns may require sophisticated approaches
- Consider team expertise when evaluating solution complexity

#### Application Examples
- API design patterns
- Error handling standardization
- Deployment pipeline design

#### Evolution History
Evolved from recurring patterns in post-mortem analyses where complex solutions led to unexpected failures or maintenance challenges.

### 3. Design for Observability

**Status**: Established  
**Confidence**: Proven  
**Origin**: Production incidents, Operations team feedback  

#### Statement
Systems should be designed from the beginning with comprehensive observability, making their internal state and behavior visible and understandable from the outside.

#### Rationale
Production systems inevitably behave differently than expected. The ability to understand what's happening internally without modifying the system is critical for troubleshooting and performance optimization.

#### Implications
- Instrumentation is a first-class concern, not an afterthought
- Logging, metrics, and tracing must be built into all components
- Key business events should be traceable end-to-end
- Health and status should be exposed in a standardized way

#### Contextual Considerations
- More critical for stateful and distributed systems
- Must balance with performance considerations
- May require different approaches in different environments (dev vs. prod)

#### Application Examples
- Distributed tracing implementation
- Standardized logging format
- Health check API endpoints
- Metrics collection framework

#### Evolution History
Initially focused on basic logging, evolved to include structured logs, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and business event tracking.

## Emerging Architectural Principles

### 4. Interface Stability

**Status**: Emerging  
**Confidence**: Tested  
**Origin**: API versioning experiences, Client integration feedback  

#### Statement
Public interfaces should maintain backward compatibility within a major version, with breaking changes clearly signaled and managed through explicit versioning.

#### Rationale
Unstable interfaces create high coordination costs, forcing simultaneous updates across multiple systems and increasing the risk of integration failures.

#### Implications
- Interface design must consider future evolution
- Breaking changes require major version increments
- Deprecated features should be marked and removed on a clear schedule
- Interface contracts should be explicit and tested

#### Contextual Considerations
- Internal interfaces between closely coordinated teams may have different stability requirements
- Experimental or rapidly evolving features may use different versioning approaches
- Security concerns may occasionally override backward compatibility

#### Application Examples
- REST API versioning strategy
- SDK interface stability guidelines
- Database schema evolution approach

#### Evolution History
Derived from integration challenges and coordination costs observed in rapidly evolving APIs.

### 5. Failure Isolation

**Status**: Emerging  
**Confidence**: Tested  
**Origin**: System reliability analyses, Incident patterns  

#### Statement
System components should be designed to fail independently, with failures contained and not cascading to unrelated functionality.

#### Rationale
In large systems, failures are inevitable. Isolation of failures allows the system to degrade gracefully rather than failing completely.

#### Implications
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads should be implemented at integration points
- Resource pools should be segregated by criticality
- Dependencies between components should be explicitly managed
- Fallback mechanisms should be designed for critical functions

#### Contextual Considerations
- More important in high-availability systems
- May introduce additional complexity and overhead
- Some functional areas have natural coupling that limits isolation

#### Application Examples
- Service circuit breakers
- Database connection pool isolation
- API request timeout and retry policies

#### Evolution History
Initially focused on service-level isolation, expanding to include resource management, dependency chains, and graceful degradation strategies.
