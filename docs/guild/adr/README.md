# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Pioneer Agent project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a choice the team has made regarding the system architecture.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this standard format:

```
# ADR-NNN: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-XXX](./adr-xxx.md)]

## Context
[Description of the problem and context]

## Decision
[Description of the decision that was made]

## Consequences
[Description of the resulting context after applying the decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[Description of alternative options that were considered]

## References
[Any relevant references or links]
```

## Creating New ADRs

To create a new ADR:

1. Copy the template from `adr-template.md`
2. Name your file `adr-NNN-title.md`, where NNN is the next number in sequence
3. Fill in the details of your architectural decision
4. Submit for review according to the Guild Protocol
