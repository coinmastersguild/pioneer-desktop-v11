# Enhanced Guild Protocols

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: Current Date  
**Status**: Proposed  

This document outlines enhanced protocols for the Pioneer Agent Guild to improve team effectiveness, code quality, and project outcomes.

## 1. Enhanced Communication Standards

### 1.1 Daily Standups

**Structure**: Daily 15-minute standups with a strict format:
- **Blockers First**: Begin with any blocking issues
- **Status Updates**: Brief updates on progress
- **Upcoming Work**: Short overview of daily goals

**Requirements**:
- All team members must attend or provide written updates
- Separate technical discussion items for post-standup
- Document action items for blockers

### 1.2 Async Communication Channels

Establish dedicated channels for specific concerns:
- **#deployment-issues**: For all deployment-related concerns
- **#architecture-decisions**: For discussing architectural changes
- **#production-incidents**: For reporting and tracking incidents
- **#sprint-planning**: For sprint coordination

**Protocol**:
- Use appropriate channel for topic-specific communication
- Tag relevant team members with @mentions
- Include links to relevant documentation/code

### 1.3 Decision Documentation

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:
- Location: `/docs/guild/adr/adr-[number]-[title].md`
- Required for all significant architectural decisions
- Must include context, considered alternatives, and rationale

**Technical Decision Log**:
- Maintain running log of smaller technical decisions
- Reference in code comments when implementing

## 2. Code Review Framework

### 2.1 Two-Tier Reviews

**Process**:
1. **Peer Review**: Initial review by team peer
2. **Senior Review**: Secondary review by senior engineer for:
   - API changes
   - Security-related code
   - Performance-critical components
   - Core architecture modifications

**Approval Requirements**:
- Standard changes: 1 peer approval
- Critical changes: 1 peer + 1 senior approval

### 2.2 Review Checklists

- Performance considerations addressed
- Security review completed

### 2.3 Review SLAs

Establish maximum response times for review requests:
- **Urgent**: Initial response within 4 hours
- **Standard**: Initial response within 24 hours
- **Non-Critical**: Initial response within 48 hours

**SLA Tracking**:
- Monitor and report on review response times
- Escalation process for SLA violations

### 2.4 Automated Pre-Reviews

**Requirements before human review**:
- All automated tests passing
- Linting issues addressed
- Type checking errors resolved
- Documentation updated

**Automated checks**:
- Test coverage not decreased
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance benchmarks not regressed

## 3. Knowledge Transfer Protocols

### 3.1 Weekly Learning Sessions

**Format**:
- 30-minute sessions
- Rotating responsibility among team members
- Focus on specific technology or codebase area

**Requirements**:
- Prepared materials/demos
- Written summary for team reference
- Q&A period

### 3.2 Skills Matrix

**Implementation**:
- Maintain team skills matrix document
- Rate expertise levels (1-5) across required skills
- Update quarterly

**Usage**:
- Identify training needs
- Guide task assignments
- Plan mentoring relationships

### 3.3 Pair Programming Schedule

**Structure**:
- Schedule formal pair programming sessions weekly
- Rotate pairs to maximize knowledge transfer
- Focus on complex or critical code areas

**Documentation**:
- Record insights gained during sessions
- Document patterns and anti-patterns identified

### 3.4 Documentation Days

**Process**:
- Dedicate last day of each sprint to documentation
- Review and update existing documentation
- Create missing documentation
- Cross-reference related documents

**Focus Areas**:
- Code documentation
- API documentation
- Architecture diagrams
- Onboarding materials

## 4. Testing Standards Enhancement

### 4.1 Test Coverage Requirements

**Minimum Coverage Standards**:
- Critical components: 90% line coverage
- Core business logic: 85% line coverage
- UI components: 75% line coverage
- Utility functions: 80% line coverage

**Enforcement**:
- Automated CI checks for coverage thresholds
- Failed builds on coverage decrease

### 4.2 Test-First Development

**Process**:
1. Write test cases before implementation
2. Review test cases with team
3. Implement code to pass tests
4. Review implementation

**Requirements**:
- Test PRs submitted separately from implementation
- Test cases must cover happy path and edge cases

### 4.3 Performance Benchmarks

**Implementation**:
- Establish baseline performance metrics for key operations
- Create automated performance tests
- Run benchmarks on every significant change

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Response time for critical API endpoints
- Query execution time
- UI rendering performance
- Memory utilization

### 4.4 Regression Test Protocol

**Selection Process**:
1. Identify impacted system areas
2. Select regression tests based on risk assessment
3. Add targeted tests for specific changes
4. Run full regression suite before deployment

**Maintenance**:
- Regular review of regression test suite
- Removal of obsolete tests
- Addition of tests for new features

## 5. Incident Management

### 5.1 Severity Classification

**Levels**:
- **SEV1**: Complete system outage
- **SEV2**: Significant functionality impaired
- **SEV3**: Minor functionality impaired
- **SEV4**: Cosmetic or non-critical issues

**Response Requirements by Level**:
- SEV1: Immediate response, all-hands required
- SEV2: Response within 1 hour, dedicated team
- SEV3: Response within 1 business day

- Review with entire team
- Track action items to completion

### 5.3 Incident Drills

**Implementation**:

## 6. Technical Debt Management

### 6.1 Debt Classification System

**Categories**:
- **High Risk**: Could cause system failure
- **Medium Risk**: Impacts performance or maintainability

- **Medium Effort**: 1-3 days to address
- **Low Effort**: <1 day to address

### 6.2 Debt Budget
