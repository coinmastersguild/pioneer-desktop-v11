- [ ] No unnecessary code duplication
- [ ] Appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## API Changes Checklist

- [ ] API versioning properly implemented
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error responses standardized
- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained (or breaking changes documented)
- [ ] Rate limiting considerations addressed
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Response format consistent with existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Security review completed

## UI Changes Checklist

## Performance-Critical Changes Checklist

- [ ] Performance testing conducted
- [ ] Resource utilization assessed (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Network traffic impact evaluated
- [ ] Database query performance analyzed
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Pagination implemented for large data sets
- [ ] Asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring added
- [ ] Load testing results documented
- [ ] Scaling considerations addressed

## Deployment Changes Checklist

- [ ] Configuration changes documented
- [ ] Environment variables updated
- [ ] Database migration scripts tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Dependencies updated and tested
- [ ] Infrastructure changes coordinated with operations
- [ ] Monitoring updates implemented
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment approach
- [ ] Post-deployment verification plan
- [ ] Feature flags implemented if needed

## How to Use These Checklists

1. Identify the type(s) of changes in the code review
2. Apply the General Review Checklist plus all applicable specific checklists
3. Document any exceptions or items that don't apply
4. Include checklist completion status in review comments

## Checklist Modification Process

These checklists should evolve based on team experience and project needs. To propose changes:

1. Create an issue with the proposed changes and rationale
2. Discuss in the Guild meeting
3. Update this document after approval
4. Communicate changes to the team
