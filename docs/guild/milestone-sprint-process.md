# DegenQuest Milestone & Sprint Process

## Overview

This document outlines the project management approach used for DegenQuest, which follows a milestone-based development process with sprints. This structure provides clear planning, execution, and reporting mechanisms to ensure project success.

## Milestone Structure

### Definition
A milestone represents a significant achievement in the project's development. Each milestone:
- Has a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Milestone 6: Durability & Observability")
- Contains multiple sprints (typically 2-4)
- Delivers a cohesive set of features or improvements
- Has defined success criteria

### Milestone Documentation
Each milestone has the following documentation:
1. **Milestone Overview Document** - Located at `docs/milestone-X/milestone-overview.md` or directly at `docs/MILESTONE-X-NAME.md`
2. **Sprint Directories** - Located at `docs/milestone-X/sprint-Y/` containing sprint-specific documentation
3. **Technical Specification Documents** - Detailed technical documents for complex features

### Milestone Components
A milestone document includes:
- Overview and goals
- Key deliverables
- Success criteria
- Timeline with sprint breakdowns
- Dependencies
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment

## Sprint Structure

### Definition
A sprint is a time-boxed development cycle (typically 2 weeks) focusing on a subset of milestone deliverables.

### Sprint Documentation
Each sprint has the following documentation:
1. **Sprint Plan** - Located at `docs/milestone-X/sprint-Y/sprint-plan.md` or `docs/sprints/milestone-X-sprintY-plan.md`
2. **Sprint Report** - Located at `docs/milestone-X/sprint-Y/sprint-report.md` or `docs/sprints/milestone-X-sprintY-report.md`

### Sprint Plan Components
A sprint plan includes:
- Sprint overview and goals
- User stories with tasks and acceptance criteria
- Story point estimations
- Sprint backlog
- Team allocation
- Dependencies
- Risk assessment
- Definition of done

### Sprint Report Components
A sprint report includes:
- Overview of accomplishments
- Key completed features
- Technical highlights
- Challenges and learnings
- Next steps
- Conclusion with overall assessment

## Guild Assessment

For significant features or architectural changes, a Guild Assessment may be produced:
- Provides an expert evaluation of proposed features
- Assesses technical feasibility, risks, and resource requirements
- Offers recommendations on implementation
- Located in `docs/guild/` directory

## Process Flow

1. **Milestone Definition**
   - Create milestone overview document
   - Define sprints within the milestone
   - Identify key deliverables and success criteria

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Break down milestone goals into user stories
   - Estimate story points
   - Allocate resources
   - Document sprint plan

3. **Sprint Execution**
   - Daily standups (documented in `docs/standups/`)
   - Task implementation and tracking
   - Regular progress updates

4. **Sprint Review**
   - Assess completed work
   - Document accomplishments and challenges
   - Create sprint report
   - Plan for next sprint

5. **Milestone Completion**
   - Verify all success criteria met
   - Document lessons learned
   - Transition to next milestone

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing this process for a new project:
1. Start by creating milestone overview documents
2. Break milestones into logical sprints
3. Create templates for sprint plans and reports
4. Establish a regular cadence for standups and reviews
5. Document all decisions and progress consistently
