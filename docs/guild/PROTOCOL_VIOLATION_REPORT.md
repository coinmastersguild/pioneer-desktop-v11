# Protocol Violation Report

**Date**: 2025-03-24 15:16  
**Status**: CRITICAL  
**Project**: KeepKey Support Email  
**Project State**: Pre-Production

## Violation Summary

A protocol violation has been identified in our sprint process regarding the Guild Sprint Protocol requirements:

**Violation**: Incomplete environment status reporting at the end of sprints.

**Severity**: Medium (Process Violation)

**Description**: The Guild Sprint Protocol mandates comprehensive status reporting of **ALL** environments at the completion of each sprint. Our current implementation provides inconsistent or incomplete reporting, focusing primarily on the production environment status rather than the full environment pipeline.

## Impact Assessment

This violation impacts:

1. **Visibility**: Reduced visibility into the complete project state
2. **Decision-making**: Incomplete data for sprint planning and prioritization
3. **Compliance**: Non-compliance with Guild standards and practices
4. **Progression**: Difficulty tracking progression through environments
5. **Documentation**: Inconsistent historical record of environment states

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this violation appears to be:

1. **Ambiguous Documentation**: The SPRINT_PROTOCOL.md document does not explicitly state the requirement to report all environment statuses at sprint completion.
2. **Incomplete Tooling**: The sprint management scripts (`manage-sprint.sh`) do not enforce full status reporting.
3. **Inconsistent Practice**: Varying interpretation of protocol requirements across sprints.
4. **Focus Misalignment**: Over-emphasis on production status without equal attention to all environments.

## Remediation Plan

The following actions will be taken to address this violation:

1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update SPRINT_PROTOCOL.md to explicitly require ALL environment status reporting
   - Create specific status reporting guidelines and templates

2. **Tooling Enhancements**:
   - Enhance `manage-sprint.sh` to capture and report all environment statuses
   - Implement a status dashboard for visualization of all environments
   - Create automation to enforce compliance with status reporting requirements

3. **Process Improvements**:
   - Update sprint templates to include placeholders for all environment statuses
   - Implement status verification checkpoints at sprint start and end
   - Create automated alerts for incomplete status reporting

4. **Historical Corrections**:
   - Backfill previous sprint summaries with complete environment statuses
   - Add annotations to identify and explain past violations
