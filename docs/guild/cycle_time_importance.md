# The Importance of Cycle Time Tracking in Guild Projects

## What is Cycle Time?

In software development, **cycle time** refers to the total elapsed time from the beginning of work on a change until that change is deployed to production and available to users. It encompasses the entire process: development, testing, review, and deployment.

For Guild projects specifically, we track two key cycle time metrics:

1. **Local Development Cycle Time**: How long it takes to make a change locally, build it in Docker, and verify it works
2. **Production Deployment Cycle Time**: How long it takes for a change to go from commit to working in production

## Why Cycle Time Matters

### 1. Accelerated Value Delivery

Shorter cycle times mean faster delivery of value to users. When we can quickly move from idea to implementation, we can:

- Respond rapidly to user feedback
- Iterate on features more frequently
- Fix bugs more quickly
- Outpace competitors in delivering new functionality

### 2. Reduced Risk

Smaller, more frequent deployments carry less risk than large, infrequent ones:

- Issues are easier to identify and isolate
- Rollbacks affect fewer changes
- The "blast radius" of any failure is contained
- Developers are more familiar with recent code changes

### 3. Improved Developer Experience

Fast cycle times directly impact developer satisfaction and productivity:

- Immediate feedback on changes
- Less context switching between tasks
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Greater sense of accomplishment from frequent deployments

### 4. Data-Driven Improvement

Measuring cycle time allows us to:

- Identify bottlenecks in our development process
- Quantify the impact of process improvements
- Make informed decisions about tooling and infrastructure
- Set realistic deadlines based on historical performance

## Current Cycle Time Performance

### Local Development Cycle Times

Based on our logs, our local development cycle times have been:

```
CYCLE 1: 42 seconds - Docker deployment build
CYCLE 2: 1 minute 22 seconds - Direct docker-compose approach
CYCLE 3: 3 minutes 38 seconds - Updated health check in Docker Compose
CYCLE 4: 1 minute 11 seconds - Debugging local Docker container
CYCLE 5: 29 seconds - Testing fixed docker-compose
CYCLE 6: 12 seconds - Final health check
CYCLE 7: 4 seconds - Adding Docker server to web portal
```

**Average local development cycle time: ~1 minute 8 seconds**

### Production Deployment Cycle Times

Our production deployment cycle times have been more variable:

```
CYCLE 1: 1 minute 1 second - CircleCI build fix
CYCLE 4: 3 minutes 45 seconds - CircleCI optimization
CYCLE 7: 46 seconds - Version 0.5.0 deployment (partial)
CYCLE 15: 4 seconds - Test cycle (limited scope)
```

**Average production deployment cycle time: ~1 minute 24 seconds** (for completed cycles)

## How We Track Cycle Time

Guild projects use a standardized approach to tracking cycle time:

1. **Local Development**: Using `docker/cycle.sh` to track local build and test cycles
2. **Production Deployment**: Using `scripts/prod-cycle.sh` to track stages of the production pipeline:
   - Code push to GitHub
   - CircleCI build
   - Docker image registry publish
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Health checks
   - End-to-end validation

## Cycle Time Goals for Guild Projects

To maintain development velocity and ensure quality, we've established the following targets:

| Cycle Type | Target Time | Current Average | Status |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Local Development | < 2 minutes | ~1 minute 8 seconds | ✅ Meeting Target |
| Production Deployment | < 10 minutes | ~1 minute 24 seconds (partial) | ⚠️ Incomplete Data |

## Improving Cycle Times

We're continuously working to improve our cycle times through:

1. **Build Optimization**:
   - Docker layer caching
   - Optimized Dockerfiles
   - Efficient package management

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Fast-running unit tests
   - Parallel test execution
   - Test environment optimization

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Streamlined CircleCI workflows
   - Optimized build steps
   - Efficient deployment strategies

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Kubernetes resource optimization
   - Efficient health checks
   - Improved rollout strategies

## Conclusion

Cycle time is a critical metric for Guild projects. By tracking and optimizing both local development and production deployment cycle times, we can deliver value faster, reduce risk, improve developer experience, and make data-driven decisions about our development process.

Every Guild project should implement cycle time tracking as a key performance indicator and strive to meet or exceed the established targets.
