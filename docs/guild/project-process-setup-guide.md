# Project Process Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the milestone and sprint process in a new project.

## Directory Structure Setup

Create the following directory structure in your project repository:

```
docs/
├── milestones/
├── sprints/
├── standups/
├── guild/
├── research/
├── architecture/
└── planning/
```

This structure supports organized documentation of all project activities.

## Process Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Project Scope

Before starting milestone planning:
1. Create a high-level project overview document
2. Define project goals and success criteria
3. Identify major features and components
4. Establish timeline constraints

### 2. Create Initial Milestones

1. Identify 3-6 major milestones that cover the entire project scope
2. Use the `docs/guild/milestone-template.md` template for each milestone
3. Name files consistently: `docs/milestones/milestone-1-name.md`
4. Ensure milestones have clear dependencies and sequences

### 3. Plan First Sprint

1. Break down the first milestone into 2-week sprints
2. Use the `docs/guild/sprint-plan-template.md` template
3. Create detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
4. Estimate story points for each user story
5. Place sprint plan in `docs/sprints/milestone-1-sprint-1-plan.md`

### 4. Establish Team Processes

1. Set up daily standup procedures
   - Use `docs/standups/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily standup notes
   - Establish a consistent format for standup notes

2. Create sprint review protocol
   - Schedule regular sprint reviews
   - Define roles for sprint reviews
   - Use the report template for documentation

3. Implement version control standards
   - Define branch naming conventions
   - Establish PR review processes
   - Link commits to user stories

### 5. Monitor and Adapt

1. After the first sprint:
   - Create a sprint report using the template
   - Review process effectiveness
   - Make adjustments to templates or processes as needed

2. Regularly review project health:
   - Track milestone progress
   - Assess risk factors
   - Adjust timelines or resources if necessary

## Tips for Successful Implementation

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one milestone and a few sprints to get team buy-in
2. **Be Consistent**: Use the templates consistently to establish patterns
3. **Automate Where Possible**: Consider creating scripts to generate template files
4. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep all documents up-to-date as the project evolves
5. **Retrospect Regularly**: Review and improve the process after each milestone

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for the first few weeks of a new project:

1. Week 1:
   - Project kickoff
   - Create project overview
   - Define first milestone
   - Plan first sprint

2. Weeks 2-3:
   - Execute first sprint
   - Daily standups
   - Regular progress updates
   - Address blockers quickly

3. End of Week 3:
   - Sprint review
   - Create sprint report
   - Plan second sprint
   - Make process adjustments

4. Ongoing:
   - Continue sprint cycles
   - Complete milestone
   - Review and improve processes
   - Plan next milestone

## Adapting to Different Project Types

The base process can be adapted to different project types:

- **Feature-Driven Projects**: Create milestones around major features
- **Time-Constrained Projects**: Define milestones based on release dates
- **Research Projects**: Add research phases before implementation sprints
- **Maintenance Projects**: Use smaller milestones with more frequent releases

Remember that the process should serve the project, not the other way around. Adapt these templates and workflows to best fit your team and project needs.
