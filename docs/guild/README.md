## Knowledge Evolution

The Guild documentation itself follows the principles outlined in our Knowledge Distillation Framework. All documents are considered living artifacts that evolve through:

1. Regular review and refinement
2. Integration of lessons learned
3. Application of emerging best practices
4. Validation through practical application

Team members are encouraged to contribute to the evolution of these documents through the processes defined in the Knowledge Distillation Framework.
