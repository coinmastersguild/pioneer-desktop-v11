# Knowledge Distillation Framework

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: Current Date  
**Status**: Proposed  

This document outlines the framework for continuous knowledge capture, distillation, and self-improvement across the Pioneer Agent Guild documentation.

## 1. Knowledge Capture Mechanisms

### 1.1 Experience Journals

**Implementation**:
- Weekly experience capture sessions (15 minutes)
- Team members document key learnings in structured format
- Location: `/docs/guild/experience-journals/[YYYY-MM]/[username].md`

**Required Format**:
```
## Week of [DATE]

### Key Learnings
- [Concise description of learning]
- [Context in which it was learned]
- [Potential broader applications]

### Technical Discoveries
- [Technical insight gained]
- [Problem it solved]
- [Generalizability assessment]

### Process Improvements
- [Process friction identified]
- [Improvement implemented/suggested]
- [Measured/expected impact]
```

### 1.2 Project Retrospective Knowledge Mining

After each project or major milestone:

1. Dedicated 1-hour knowledge mining session
2. Team identifies patterns, reusable solutions, and anti-patterns
3. Artifacts created:
   - Reusable solution templates
   - Anti-pattern catalog entries
   - Architecture principles refinements

### 1.3 Automated Knowledge Indicators

**Technical Implementation**:
- Git commit message tagging system (#learning, #pattern, #issue)
- Automated weekly digest of tagged insights
- Code comment special format for knowledge extraction

## 2. Knowledge Distillation Process

### 2.1 Monthly Knowledge Synthesis

**Process**:
1. Knowledge Steward reviews experience journals and project retrospectives
2. Identifies recurring patterns and valuable insights
3. Categorizes by domain (technical, process, architecture)
4. Creates draft knowledge artifacts

**Artifacts Produced**:
- Pattern descriptions in pattern library
- Process improvement proposals
- Architecture principle refinements
- FAQ updates

### 2.2 Quarterly Knowledge Codification

**Process**:
1. Review monthly syntheses for the quarter
2. Elevate proven patterns to formal status
3. Update formal documentation
4. Archive raw knowledge sources with cross-references

**Review Panel**:
- Principal Engineer/Architect
- Guild Leader
- Knowledge Steward
- Rotating Team Member

### 2.3 Knowledge Testing Protocol

Before formally adopting patterns or principles:

1. Develop explicit hypotheses about value
2. Define measurable outcomes
3. Create practical test cases
4. Apply in controlled scope
5. Measure results against hypotheses
6. Document outcomes, including unexpected results

## 3. Documentation Evolution System

### 3.1 Living Document Framework

**Key Principles**:
- All guild docs are living documents with explicit lifecycles
- Every document has metadata for evaluating currency/relevance
- Clear versioning and change tracking
- Retirement process for obsolete information

**Document Metadata**:
```
---
title: Document Title
version: X.Y
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
last_review: YYYY-MM-DD
next_review: YYYY-MM-DD
review_cycle: [Monthly|Quarterly|Biannually|Annually]
relevance_score: [1-5]
knowledge_confidence: [Experimental|Tested|Proven|Core]
---
```

### 3.2 Document Health Metrics

**Automated Monitoring**:
- Age of document relative to review cycle
- Reference frequency (links from other docs)
- Usage metrics (views, time spent)
- Feedback ratings

**Manual Assessment**:
- Relevance to current technology stack
- Alignment with current practices
- Clarity and completeness
- Actionability of content

### 3.3 Continuous Refinement Process

**Regular Activities**:
- Biweekly documentation improvement sessions
- Monthly documentation health reports
- Quarterly documentation pruning and consolidation
- Annual comprehensive review

## 4. Knowledge Application Systems

### 4.1 Decision Support Framework

**Implementation**:
- Decision template incorporating distilled knowledge
- Required referencing of relevant patterns and principles
- Decision outcome feedback loop

**Template**:
```
# Decision: [Title]

## Context
[Problem description]

## Relevant Knowledge Artifacts
- [Pattern/Principle/Learning and how it applies]
- [Anti-patterns to avoid]

## Decision
[Description of decision]

## Expected Outcomes
[Measurable expectations]

## Feedback Cycle
[When and how to evaluate actual outcomes]
```

### 4.2 Knowledge Activation Practices

**Mechanisms**:
- Weekly "pattern of the week" focus
- Knowledge application challenges
- Cross-team knowledge exchanges
- Brown bag sessions on emerging patterns

### 4.3 New Member Onboarding Knowledge Path

**Structure**:
1. Core knowledge artifacts (essential understanding)
2. Domain-specific knowledge maps
3. Guided exploration of knowledge repository
4. Knowledge application exercises
5. Knowledge contribution onboarding

## 5. Guild-Wide Knowledge Metrics

### 5.1 Knowledge Health Indicators

**Key Metrics**:
- Knowledge cycle time (discovery to codification)
- Knowledge application rate (documented usage)
- Knowledge confidence evolution
- Anti-pattern recurrence rate
- Documentation freshness score

### 5.2 Knowledge Gap Analysis

**Quarterly Process**:
1. Map existing knowledge against current needs
2. Identify underrepresented areas
3. Assess depth vs. breadth of current knowledge
4. Prioritize gap-filling activities

### 5.3 Knowledge Impact Assessment

**Framework**:
- Define impact criteria for knowledge artifacts
- Track application in projects/decisions
- Measure outcomes against expectations
- Calculate ROI of knowledge management efforts

## 6. Architecture Knowledge Specialization

### 6.1 Architecture Decision Knowledge Repository

Extend the ADR framework with:
- Pattern application tracking
- Decision efficacy assessment
- Cross-linking with technical implementations
- Evolution tracking for architectural decisions

### 6.2 Architecture Principle Derivation Process

**Process**:
1. Extract implicit principles from successful decisions
2. Test principle applicability across contexts
3. Formalize principles with clear rationales
4. Create practical application guidelines
5. Track principle evolution over time

### 6.3 Architecture Learning Feedback Loop

**Implementation**:
- Scheduled architecture reviews with knowledge focus
- Architecture decision effectiveness assessments
- Principle refinement based on outcomes
- Anti-pattern catalog with root cause analysis

## 7. Implementation Approach

### 7.1 Phase 1 (Immediate)
- Establish experience journals
- Create initial document metadata structure
- Begin weekly knowledge sharing sessions

### 7.2 Phase 2 (Within 1 month)
- Implement knowledge steward role
- Begin monthly synthesis process
- Create pattern library structure
- Deploy document health monitoring

### 7.3 Phase 3 (Within 3 months)
- Launch full quarterly codification process
- Implement knowledge metrics dashboard
- Begin knowledge gap analysis
- Integrate with architecture processes

## Conclusion

This Knowledge Distillation Framework creates a systematic approach to capturing, refining, and applying knowledge across the Pioneer Agent Guild. By treating knowledge as a first-class product, we enable continuous improvement of both our documentation and our technical practices.

*This framework should evolve based on its effectiveness in improving the team's knowledge management capabilities. Regular assessment of the framework itself is essential to its success.*
