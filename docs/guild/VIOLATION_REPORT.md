# Guild Protocol Violation Report

## Violation ID: MAGA-VIO-001

**Date**: 2025-03-24 14:55  
**Reporter**: System Verification Tool  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Remediated

## Violation Description

Placeholder data was used in the deployment status tracking system that indicated GREEN status across all environments when actual deployment statuses had not been verified. This represents a serious MAGA protocol violation as it could have led to premature production deployment with unverified systems.

## Affected Components

- `/docs/deployment/status-tracker.md`
- Status verification system
- Deployment promotion process

## Protocol Reference

**MAGA-DEPLOY-001 Section 3.2**: "Accurate status reporting is required for all environments. Status must reflect actual verification of deployment health and functionality, not assumed or anticipated statuses."

## Impact

1. **Security**: Low - No security breach occurred
2. **Quality**: High - Could have permitted faulty code to reach production
3. **Compliance**: High - Direct violation of Guild protocol
4. **Trust**: Medium - Automated status verification caught the violation

## Root Cause Analysis

The placeholder data was populated during initial document creation without proper verification of actual deployment statuses. Documentation was created ahead of actual implementation and testing.

## Resolution

1. Status tracker was immediately updated with accurate status information
2. All environments now correctly show YELLOW or RED status reflecting their true implementation state
3. Verification script successfully detected and flagged the violation

## Preventative Measures

1. Status updates must be executed by verification scripts only, not manual editing
2. Addition of automated testing to prevent placeholders in status documents
3. Implementation of a peer review requirement for all status changes

## Approvals

- [ ] Team Lead Review
- [ ] Guild Protocol Officer Review
- [ ] DevOps Team Notification

## Violation ID: MAGA-VIO-002

**Date**: 2025-03-24 16:00  
**Reporter**: Assistant  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Active

## Violation Description

Assistant provided unverified status information about local deployment state without performing proper verification checks or accessing current status data. This represents a serious protocol violation as it could lead to misinformation about deployment readiness and false confidence in system state.

## Affected Components

- Status reporting system
- Local deployment verification
- Guild communication protocol

## Protocol Reference

**MAGA-DEPLOY-001 Section 2.1**: "Status reporting must be based on actual verification, not assumptions or historical data. All status claims must be backed by current verification data."

## Impact

1. **Trust**: High - Provided potentially incorrect information about system state
2. **Quality**: Medium - Could lead to decisions based on incorrect status
3. **Compliance**: High - Direct violation of Guild verification protocol
4. **Security**: Low - No direct security impact

## Root Cause Analysis

The assistant made assumptions about deployment status without:
1. Performing current status verification
2. Checking actual health endpoints
3. Verifying current status tracker data
4. Running required verification scripts

## Resolution Steps

1. Immediate retraction of unverified status claims
2. Proper verification of current local deployment status required
3. Status must be reported only after running verification tools:
   ```bash
   ./skills/verify-health-endpoint.sh http://localhost:3000
   ./skills/verify-local.sh
   ```
4. Update status tracker only with verified information

## Preventative Measures

1. Implementation of mandatory verification before status reporting
2. Addition of explicit verification step in status reporting workflow
3. Enhanced logging of status verification attempts
4. Regular audits of status reporting accuracy

## Approvals Required

- [ ] Team Lead Review
- [ ] Guild Protocol Officer Review
- [ ] Status Verification Officer
